            Yuji Itadori, a kind-hearted teenager, joins his school's Occult Club for fun, but discovers that its members 
            are actual sorcerers who can manipulate the energy between beings for their own use. He hears about a cursed 
            talisman - the finger of Sukuna, a demon - and its being targeted by other cursed beings. Yuji eats the finger 
            to protect his friends, and ends up becoming Sukuna's host. However, Yuji discovers that he has inherited magic and is able 
            to control this power without interference from Sukuna. He joins the Tokyo Metropolitan Magic Technical College to consumes all 
            of Sukuna's fingers, which will enable a full exorcism to take place that will free him.
