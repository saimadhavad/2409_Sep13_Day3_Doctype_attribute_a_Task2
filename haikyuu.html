       <p>
        Hinata Shouyou, a short middle school student, gained a sudden love of volleyball after watching a national championship 
        match on TV. Determined to become like the championship's star player, a short boy nicknamed "the small giant", Shouyou joined 
        his school's volleyball club. Unfortunately, he was the only member and the club didn't have so much as a place to practice. 
        He didn't let that deter him, however, and, upon finally acquiring 5 other players in his final year, was able to compete in an 
        actual competition - only for his team to be unlucky enough to face the championship favorite and its star player, 
        Kageyama Tobio, called "the king of the court", in the first round. Though Shouyou's team suffers a crushing defeat, 
        he vows to become better and eventually surpass Kageyama. Now Shouyou is starting his first year in high school - the very one he had 
        first watched in the national championships. He's going to join the volleyball team, practice constantly, and wipe the floor with 
        Kageyama the next time they meet on the court. ...or at least that's what Shouyou had planned, until he discovers that he and 
        Kageyama are now in the same school. The volleyball team definitely needs their skills, but only if they can stop bickering and 
        learn to work together as teammates.
